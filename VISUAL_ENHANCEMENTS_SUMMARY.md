## Design Choices

### Color Coding:
- **Teal (#48C9B0)**: Success, value, Oklo brand
- **Light Blue (#5DADE2)**: Beginning, neutral milestone
- **Orange (#FF6600)**: Challenge, pivot point, attention
- **White text**: Maximum contrast on dark backgrounds
- **Gray**: Neutral market representation

### Sizing:
- Slide 2 icons: 0.35" diameter (small enough for 80, large enough to see)
- Slide 5 timeline circles: 0.8" diameter (prominent milestones)
- Font sizes: 11pt-36pt range for hierarchy

### Spacing:
- Clean grid spacing prevents cluttering
- Timeline positioned at vertical center for balance
- Legend/callouts positioned in negative space

## How to Present These Slides

### Slide 2:
1. Say: "Over 80 new nuclear startups have entered the market"
2. **GESTURE** to the grid of icons
3. Say: "That's $4 billion in funding" - **POINT** to the callout
4. Say: "Each of these represents a potential client" - **POINT** to highlighted icons

### Slide 5:
1. Say: "In 2020, Oklo submitted..." - **POINT** to blue circle
2. Say: "In 2022, the NRC rejected it" - **POINT** to orange circle
3. Say: "But we transformed that into..." - **TRACE** the curved arrow
4. Say: "A $140 million knowledge asset" - **POINT** to teal circle
5. **GESTURE** to checklist: "We now know exactly what works"
