## SLIDE-BY-SLIDE BREAKDOWN

### SLIDE 2: "80+ New nuclear startups need help"

#### Numbers:
- **80+ startups**
- **~$4B+ in total funding**

#### Sources:
**80 startups:**
- StartUs Insights (2025). "10+ Nuclear Energy Startups to Watch in 2025"
- Energy Startups (2025). "Top 35 Nuclear Energy startups"
- **Note**: The slidedoc mentions "80+ SMR designs in development globally" and "90+ advanced reactor technologies"

**$4B funding:**
This is calculated from known funding rounds:
- TerraPower: $1.4B
- X-energy: $1.0B
- Kairos: $629M
- Newcleo: $677M
- **Total: $3.706B** (rounded to ~$4B)

**Source:** TechCrunch (2025). "Nuclear fission startups backed by Big Tech"

**Calculation:**
```
$1.4B + $1.0B + $0.629B + $0.677B = $3.706B ‚âà $4B+
```

### SLIDE 3: "The Crowded Market"

#### Content:
Shows visualization of the competitive landscape (TerraPower, X-energy, Kairos, Newcleo)

#### Source:
Same as Slide 2 - TechCrunch (2025) for funding data

---

### SLIDE 4: "What They All Need"

#### Numbers:
- **10+ years** of licensing timeline
- **$50M+** in regulatory costs
- **Zero** reactor experience

#### Sources:
**10+ years licensing:**
- Utility Dive (2023). "NuScale Power's SMR design first in US to get NRC approval"
- **Real example**: NuScale took 6+ years (2016-2023) from COLA to certification
- **Typical timeline**: 3-7 years for design certification
- **Total to operation**: 8-12 years (including pre-application phase)

**$50M+ regulatory costs:**
From the slidedoc calculation:
- Licensing preparation: $5-20M before COLA submission
- Ongoing NRC engagement: $2-5M/year during review
- Testing/validation: $10-50M (safety case development)
- **Total pre-revenue burn: $50-200M** depending on complexity

**Source:**
- Federal Register (2023)
- NRC data
- Canary Media (2021)

**Zero reactor experience:**
- Qualitative statement - most new startups haven't submitted NRC applications
- Based on the fact that NuScale is the ONLY approved SMR as of 2023

**Source:** U.S. Department of Energy (2023). "NRC Approves First U.S. SMR Design"

---

### SLIDE 5: "Oklo has already done this"

#### Numbers:
- **2020** - First NRC Application
- **2022** - NRC Rejection
- **2025** - Current year
- **$140M** Knowledge Asset/Expertise

#### Sources:
**2020/2022 dates:**
- U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (2025). "Oklo, Inc., Product-Based Operator Licensing Framework"
- POWER Magazine (2025). "Oklo Relaunches NRC Licensing Process"
- NRC (2020) - original filing
- **Historical fact**: Oklo was first custom COLA for advanced non-light water reactor

**$140M "Knowledge Asset":**
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is NOT an actual asset valuation**. This number is the same as the 2030 revenue target from Slide 6.

The presentation is saying: "The knowledge Oklo gained is worth $140M in future revenue potential"

**Source:** This is a **projection/estimate**, not from external sources. See Slide 6 calculation.

---

### SLIDE 6: "Three Revenue Streams"

#### Numbers (2030 Annual Revenue Targets):
- **$75M** - Licensing & Regulatory
- **$42M** - Safety & Simulation
- **$23M** - Fuel Cycle
- **Total: $140M**

#### Calculation:
```
$75M + $42M + $23M = $140M ‚úì
```

#### Source:
‚ö†Ô∏è **These are ESTIMATES/PROJECTIONS, not from external sources.**

From the slidedoc, these are described as:
- Licensing & Regulatory: "$50-80M/yr target" ‚Üí chose $75M
- Safety & Simulation: "$30-50M/yr target" ‚Üí chose $42M
- Fuel Cycle: "$15-25M/yr target" ‚Üí chose $23M

**How these ranges were determined:**
Based on the market sizing in Slide 7 (working backwards from 30% market share goal)

**No external source provided for these specific numbers.**

---

### SLIDE 7: "Market Opportunity"

#### Numbers:
- **$6.2B** - Global Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- **$1.9B** - U.S. Serviceable Market
- **$570M** - Our Target

#### Calculations:

**$6.2B Global TAM:**
```
Formula: 80 startups √ó Average lifetime spend per startup
$6.2B √∑ 80 = $77.5M per startup lifetime spend
```

From the slidedoc calculation:
```
80 startups √ó $5-20M licensing costs = $400M-1.6B total industry spend
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue:** $6.2B assumes higher spend per startup ($77.5M) than just licensing costs ($5-20M). This likely includes ALL consulting spend (licensing + safety + fuel cycle) over multiple years.

**$1.9B U.S. Market:**
```
$1.9B √∑ $6.2B = 30.6%
```
**Assumption:** ~30% of the global market is U.S.-based or in allied nations where Oklo can operate

**$570M Our Target:**
```
$570M √∑ $1.9B = 30%
```
**Stated goal:** Capture 30% market share by 2030

#### Source:
‚ö†Ô∏è **These are DERIVED CALCULATIONS, not from external sources.**

The calculation works backwards:
1. Start with 80 startups (from industry data)
2. Estimate their total consulting spend over lifetime
3. Narrow to U.S. market (~30%)
4. Target 30% market share
5. Results in $570M target

**No external validation provided for the $6.2B TAM figure.**

### SLIDE 8: "5-Year Growth" (CHART DATA)

#### Numbers (Year-by-Year Revenue):

| Year | Licensing | Safety | Fuel | **TOTAL** |
|------|-----------|--------|------|-----------|
| 2026 | $3.0M | $1.0M | $0.5M | **$4.5M** |
| 2027 | $15.0M | $6.0M | $2.0M | **$23.0M** |
| 2028 | $38.0M | $20.0M | $9.0M | **$67.0M** |
| 2029 | $65.0M | $35.0M | $18.0M | **$118.0M** |
| 2030 | $75.0M | $42.0M | $23.0M | **$140.0M** |

#### Source:
‚ö†Ô∏è **These are PROJECTIONS, not from external sources.**

**How they were calculated:**
These appear to be worked BACKWARDS from the $140M 2030 target and distributed across:
- Three service lines (Licensing, Safety, Fuel Cycle)
- Five years of growth
- Matching the client acquisition roadmap in Slide 10

**Growth rates:**
```
2026‚Üí2027: $4.5M ‚Üí $23M = 411% growth
2027‚Üí2028: $23M ‚Üí $67M = 191% growth
2028‚Üí2029: $67M ‚Üí $118M = 76% growth
2029‚Üí2030: $118M ‚Üí $140M = 19% growth
```

**No external benchmark or justification provided for these growth rates.**

---

### SLIDE 9: "Profitability"

#### Numbers:
- **$42M EBITDA** by 2030
- **35-40% margin**

#### Calculation Check:
```
If Revenue = $140M and EBITDA = $42M:
Actual Margin = $42M √∑ $140M = 30%
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **ERROR FOUND:**
- Slide claims: 35-40% margin
- Actual calculation: 30% margin
- **These numbers don't match!**

If margin were actually 35-40%:
- At 35%: $140M √ó 35% = $49M EBITDA
- At 40%: $140M √ó 40% = $56M EBITDA

#### Source:
**From the speaker script:** "35-40% margin‚Äîexceptional for professional services"

**Benchmark mentioned:** Nuclear consulting firms charge $250-500/hour

**Source for consulting rates:**
- Enercon Services (2025). "Regulatory Services"
- Sargent & Lundy (2025). "Nuclear Power"

‚ö†Ô∏è **But the actual EBITDA math doesn't support the margin claim.**

---

### SLIDE 10: "4-Year Roadmap"

#### Numbers (Client Count Targets):
- **2026**: 3 clients (Launch)
- **2027**: 20 clients (Scale)
- **2028**: 40 clients (Expand)
- **2030**: 100+ clients (Lead)

#### Revenue Per Client (derived):
```
2026: $4.5M √∑ 3 = $1.5M per client
2027: $23M √∑ 20 = $1.15M per client
2028: $67M √∑ 40 = $1.675M per client
2030: $140M √∑ 100 = $1.4M per client
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistency:** Revenue per client varies ($1.5M ‚Üí $1.15M ‚Üí $1.675M ‚Üí $1.4M)

#### Source:
‚ö†Ô∏è **These are TARGETS/GOALS, not from external sources.**

From the slidedoc:
- Month 1-3: Identify and approach initial clients
- Target 10-20 startups for pilot program
- No detailed sales pipeline or acquisition model provided

**No external validation for these client count targets.**

---

### SLIDE 11: "The Investment"

#### Numbers:
- **$2M** initial investment
- **$140M by 2030** (revenue)
- **70x return** in 4 years

#### Calculation Check:
```
$140M √∑ $2M = 70x ‚úì (correct)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **But this is MISLEADING:**
- $140M is REVENUE, not profit
- $42M EBITDA is closer to actual return
- **Actual return on EBITDA:** $42M √∑ $2M = **21x** (not 70x)

#### What the $2M covers:
From the slidedoc and speaker script:
- Hiring 3-5 senior consultants (licensing experts, safety engineers)
- Software tools and modeling platforms
- Marketing and business development
- Legal entity setup and compliance

#### Source:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Investment amount is an ESTIMATE.**

The slidedoc mentions a different figure:
- "Investment Required: $14-20M"
- "ROI: 4.4x - 6.3x over 3 years"

‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR DISCREPANCY:**
- Slide shows: $2M investment, 70x return
- Slidedoc shows: $14-20M investment, 4.4x-6.3x return

**These are completely different financial models!**

---

## üîç SIMPLE CALCULATION FORMULAS

### Market Opportunity:
```
Global TAM = 80 startups √ó $77.5M average lifetime spend = $6.2B
U.S. Market = $6.2B √ó 30% = $1.9B
Our Target = $1.9B √ó 30% market share = $570M
```

### Revenue Target:
```
Total 2030 Revenue = Licensing + Safety + Fuel Cycle
$140M = $75M + $42M + $23M
```

### Profitability:
```
EBITDA Margin = EBITDA √∑ Revenue
30% = $42M √∑ $140M
(Note: Slide incorrectly claims 35-40%)
```

### ROI:
```
Revenue Multiple = Revenue √∑ Investment
70x = $140M √∑ $2M

Profit Multiple = EBITDA √∑ Investment
21x = $42M √∑ $2M
(More realistic measure)
```

### Revenue Per Client:
```
2026: $4.5M √∑ 3 clients = $1.5M per client
2027: $23M √∑ 20 clients = $1.15M per client
2028: $67M √∑ 40 clients = $1.675M per client
2030: $140M √∑ 100 clients = $1.4M per client
```
